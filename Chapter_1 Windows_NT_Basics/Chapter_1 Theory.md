## Architecture of Windows NT
Before we begin our journey into syscalls, direct syscalls and indirect syscalls, we need to understand some basics about the architecture of Windows NT.
Introduced in 1993, the Microsoft Windows New Technology (NT) operating system marked a pivotal moment in the evolution of Microsoft's operating systems. It represented a significant departure from its predecessors, providing a robust, secure and versatile platform tailored for enterprise applications.

Understanding the nature of this transition requires a brief look back at the state of Windows before NT. The pre-NT versions of Windows were essentially 16-bit systems that functioned more as graphical shells on top of MS-DOS. They had limitations such as limited memory usage and a lack of memory protection between processes. Security and networking features were minimal and often rudimentary. This architectural design often led to system instability and inefficiencies that hindered the overall performance of the operating system.
