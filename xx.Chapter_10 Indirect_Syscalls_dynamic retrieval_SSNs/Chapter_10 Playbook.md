## LAB Exercise 6: Dynamic Retrieval from SSNs

In the first bonus chapter we want to further develop our indirect syscall dropper. Until now, we had the limitation that our dropper would only work in the context of the Windows version that was used to debug the system service numbers (SSNs) for the used native functions ``NtAllocateVirtualMemory``, ``NtWriteVirtualMemory``, ``NtCreateThreadEx`` and ``NtWaitForSingleObject``. Why? Because to get the basics for direct and indirect syscalls, we have implemented the SSNs as hardcoded values in our assembly resource file. But normally, when we are preparing for a red team engagement, we do not know the Windows version of our target client. So we want to make our indirect syscall dropper a bit more flexible and instead of hardcoding the SSNs, we want to retrieve them dynamically at runtime from ntdll.dll.
